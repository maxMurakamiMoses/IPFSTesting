        I&apos;m an undergraduate student at Duke studying Philosophy and Computer Science. I find philosophy immensely compelling because it trains me to think from a structured, first-principles perspective, which is becoming increasingly indispensable in comprehending our intricate and opinionated world. Delving into philosophical inquiries encourages me to question assumptions, explore fundamental principles, and develop coherent frameworks for understanding reality. Computer science appeals to me because it offers the opportunity to create products that meet people&apos;s needs. I am particularly interested in blockchain technology as I&apos;m fascinated by its potential to revolutionize various industries and combat centralized systems.
